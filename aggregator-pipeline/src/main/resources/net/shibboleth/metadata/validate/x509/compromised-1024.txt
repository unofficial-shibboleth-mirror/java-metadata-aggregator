# This is a list of known-compromised 1024-bit keys in OpenSSL format.
#
# Derive new values from a private key file as follows:
#
#   openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in /tmp/key.pem | sha1sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
#
# You can also derive a new blacklist value from an X.509 certificate as follows:
#
#   openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in /tmp/cert.pem | sha1sum | cut -d ' ' -f 2
#
# In either case, you should then remove the first 20 characters; in other words,
# the blacklist line should be the lower 80 bits of the fingerprint).
