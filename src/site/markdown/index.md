# About the Metadata Aggregator

The Shibboleth Metadata Aggregator (MDA) is a framework and tool for processing
metadata, with an emphasis on SAML metadata.

The [`mda-framework`](mda-framework/index.html) "Processing Framework"
module provides the core processing framework, including many components
useful for processing metadata within that framework.

For more information, including how to install and configure the command-line tool,
see [the MDA wiki](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MA1).
You may also find the framework's [Javadoc](mda-framework/apidocs/index.html)
valuable, particularly if your application is configured using Java.
